# React Redux Feedback App

This was an individual weekend assignment aimed at giving us practice storing and retreiving data using React-Redux.

## Description

The user is navigated through a series of pages and is prompted on each to enter feedback information about the course. There is a Review page that allows the user to see all entered information before submitting the feedback. After submittal, the user is taken back to the beginning of the feedback process.

## Technologies Used

The app is built with a React.js frontend, an Express server, and a PostgreSQL database. Each sequencial page in the app is a React component, and input feedback data from each is stored in the Redux store before being sent to the server and to the database.
